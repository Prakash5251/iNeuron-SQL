Database as a Service (DBaaS)

Database as a Service is a cloud computing service model that provides database management and access without the need for users to manage the underlying hardware or software infrastructure. DBaaS offers benefits such as:

- Scalability: Easily scale databases up or down based on demand.

- Cost-Efficiency: Pay only for the resources used, reducing upfront infrastructure costs.

- Automated Maintenance: Service providers handle tasks like backups, updates, and security.

- Global Accessibility: Access databases from anywhere with an internet connection.
