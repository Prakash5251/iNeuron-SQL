Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

An RDBMS is a type of database management system that uses a relational model to organise data into tables with rows and columns. Key features of RDBMS include:

- Data Integrity: Enforces referential integrity and constraints to maintain the accuracy of relationships between tables.

- Structured Query Language (SQL): Provides a standardised language for querying and manipulating data in relational databases.

- ACID Properties: Ensures that database transactions are reliable and consistent (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

- Scalability: Supports the growth of data and users while maintaining performance.
