What is Data?

Data refers to raw facts and figures, often represented in a structured or unstructured format, that can be processed to derive meaningful information. 
In the context of databases and SQL, data can include anything from text and numbers to images and multimedia content. 
Effective data management involves organizing, storing, retrieving, and analyzing this information to support decision-making and business operations.
