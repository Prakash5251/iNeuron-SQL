Types of Databases

There are different types of databases based on their structure and functionality:

1. Relational Databases: Organise data into tables with predefined relationships between them.

2. NoSQL Databases: Designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and offer flexible schemas.

3. Object-Oriented Databases: Organise data in the form of objects, supporting complex data types.

4. Graph Databases: Optimal for representing and querying relationships between data entities.

5. In-memory Databases: Store data in the computer's main memory (RAM) for faster access.
